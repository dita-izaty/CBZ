CandyBongZ Ring Animation

The Korean girl group TWICE's official lightstick name is Candy Bong Z. 
TWICE fans on Twitter created a Encouragement Project called #CandybongsToTWICE at the time  to cheer TWICE on before their English Single Promotion. 

I wanted to participate in the project, but I didn't have a CandyBong Z at the time, so I took the initiative to make it digitally using CSS Animation Effects. 
And this is the CandyBong Z ring I made at the time https://candybongz-ring-animation.netlify.app/, the results aren't very similar, but I really like it. 
And as a fan, I'm happy because I can follow this project using what I've learned.
